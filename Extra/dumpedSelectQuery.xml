Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Gregory Walker, flying remote-controlled technological tools for the modern day.
March 2012.Gregory Walker took two aircraft to test the viability of the unmanned aircraft to help in the Steller sea lion research conducted by the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) along the Aleutian Islands. The videos explain some of the practicalities of using unmanned aircraft for this purpose.


-
The other main objective was to determine the diet of Steller's sea lions in the Aleutians in winter, likely the toughest period of the year for sea lions to survive in this area. The western population of Steller's sea lion (those breeding on rookeries located west of 144W, or from Prince William Sound west in Alaska and in Russia) is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed to remove the eastern population (east of 144W in SE AK, British Columbia and WA, OR and CA) from the list of threatened species since it has increased at about 3% per year for over 30 years. This de-listing should occur shortly.
-
Steller's sea lion numbers continue to decline in the Aleutian Islands west of about 177W, and the National Marine Fisheries Service recently imposed new fishery regulations to try to stem the decline and promote recovery. These regulations are controversial because in one area (western Aleutians from 170-177E) they resulted in the closing of the Atka mackerel and Pacific cod fisheries. As a consequence, NMFS has sharpened it research focus on the Aleutian Islands to try to understand the continued decline of sea lions in this area. More about the March 2012 Cruise.

The team is shown here at the end of their three week research at Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Norseman took the team from Attu to Dutch Harbor in March 2012 through all kinds of weather, snow, sun, rain, 10 foot seas, including a couple of hurricanes.
The Cruise was funded by grants from the North Pacific Research Board, the Pollock Conservation Cooperative Research Center of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and NOAA Fisheries.

Alutiiq Weavers
The Alutiiq Weavers presented in these vodcasts traveled to Russia to see baskets made by their ancestors. The baskets reside in collections at the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (MAE) in St. Petersburg, obtained by Russian explorers during the late 1700's, 1800's from Alaskan towns and villages.
-
The study of these collections, along with field research, are powerful tools for heritage revitalization. The Alutiiq weavers have come back to their communities to share how they were inspired and what they learned by viewing their collected heritage in Russia.

			<post_content>Arctic ground squirrel research -- Every year during hibernation they survive the lowest body temperature of any vertebrate (-2.9Â°C, below freezing). In Arctic extremes lacking regular day-night rhythms, they sustain regimented schedules with a superpowered internalized clock function. Arctic ground squirrels are extraordinary animals living unusual lives. Gaining insight into these creatures' many mysteries and developing an understanding of their exacting scheduling skills may help defeat a whole host of human diseases. Join scientists studying the charismatic furball that's been dubbed the perfect yuppie pet.

			<post_content>Arctic Snow, Imnaviat Creek Snowmelt
The studies at Imnaviat Creek north of the Brooks Range in Alaska have measured snow melt since 1984... representing the longest ongoing record of snowmelt and runoff. Scientists there can tell you it's never a uniform melt. Snow melt is a process; it clears out patchily, leaving some ground exposed to the sky while other areas are still cloaked in snow so deep the researchers must wear snowshoes.
Matthew Sturm, geophysics professor at the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, calls the Imnaviat Creek studies a 'ground-truth spot', a place that can help us refine our understanding of snow and how we interpret snow data.

			<research_category>arcticwintercruise2011</research_category>
			<post_content>We are embarking on a 6-week cruise to the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas on USCGC Healy. We leave Seward AK on Nov. 7 and we return to Dutch Harbor AK on Dec. 17, 2011. We have identified a set of key transects in the various cross-shelf-slope regimes along which we will conduct physical (hydrography, circulation), chemical (nutrients, dissolved organic matter), and biological (zooplankton, microzooplankton, chlorophyll, marine bird and mammal) sampling (see map of our proposed station locations). Our objectives include describing the hydrography, circulation and aspects of the planktonic, nutrient, and dissolved organic matter environments environments, describe the transformation of water types during formation of sea ice, identifying the overwintering habitat of Calanus spp. and overwintering strategies of phytoplankton, determining the condition and activity (respiration) of Calanus spp., euphausiids, bacteria, and phytoplankton, describing the interconnectedness between species/populations of Calanus and euphausiids in these regions and quantifying the course- and fine-scale vertical distributions of plankton and particles in relation to the vertical structure of the water column.
Our overall objectives are to collect some of the first winter information on the overwintering physical and biological characteristics of three important Arctic Seas: The Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, and the Beaufort Sea. The Arctic system is undergoing significant changes related to a warming climate, most notably decreased sea ice cover, which may have significant impacts on Arctic ecosystems. Our understanding of seasonality, and of winter conditions and biological and physical processes during that time, in the Arctic is severely limited because it has been so difficult to access these winter seas. In particular, understanding of the overwintering strategies of one of the dominant copepod genera, Calanusspp., is not well understood but is critical to ecosystem modeling efforts. This lack of knowledge has compromised our ability to model and to predict future states of Arctic ecosystems, efforts that are central to our ability to understand the potential impacts of ongoing climate change.
Copepods are small crustacean plankton (6-10 mm or smaller) and are important components of the oceanic food web. They eat phytoplankton (plant plankton), ice algae (algae growing on or under ice), and microzooplankton (zooplankton smaller than copepods) and in turn are eaten by larger crustaceans, jellyfish, fish, sea birds, and marine mammals such as the bowhead whale. One of the more important copepod types in terms of overall biomass are species of the genus Calanus. Calanus spp. follow a life history, or life cycle, in which they spend the summer, productive months near the surface of the ocean feeding on phytoplankton and microzooplankton and then migrate to deeper water (~100-200 m) to overwinter in a type of hibernation called diapause. We know that Calanus spp. found in other parts of the world ocean, such as the northwest Atlantic, can only diapause in the deep water; they are not found on the shallow continental shelves. But what happens on the vast expanses of the Bering and Chukchi Seas? These shelves are too shallow for Calanus spp. to diapause, according to what we believe about their life history. We are also interested in understanding how euphausiids, or krill, overwinter. Krill are larger than copepods and resemble shrimp. They also are important links in the Arctic food web and provide food for upper trophic levels.
Frontier Scientists presents a guest account of oceanic research aboard the USCG's icebreaker Healy during the Arctic Winter Cruise 2011. The team goal of the Arctic Winter Cruise 2011 under Chief Scientist Carin Ashjian was to explore the early winter ocean conditions, biological, physical, and chemical, in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas to better understand what happens there during winter.

			<research_category>arcticsamazingbirds</research_category>
			<post_content>Avian Migration -- Alaska is a hotspot for migratory birds which come to the state seeking breeding grounds with plentiful food and few predators. But life isn't easy for these far-flyers. In these videos, scientists with the University of California Davis' Birds and Seasonality project work to understand how migratory songbird species adjust to thrive despite the challenges of unpredictable Arctic weather.
Arctic's Amazing Birds
Spectacled Eiders, Snowy Owls, Bar-Tailed Godwits are just a few of the birds that call Alaska and the Arctic home at least for the summer. Tons of insects and open habitat are the perfect place for their new hatchlings. It's only a flight away. For some birds it quite a journey
-
Spectacled Eiders, Frontier Scientists first bird story is a unique one. Scientist, Margaret Peterson was determined to find out where the Spectacled Eiders migrated to during the winter months. Peterson used satellite technology early on to try to track the Eiders. Unfortunately the battery life on the transmitters wasn't that long in the 1990's, about 4-6 months. But finally, one transmitter beeped out a signal that they were able to follow. And to their surprise, well, watch the video.
-
Bar-tailed Godwit: In North America, this large (males 250-350 g, females 300-500g) shorebird is only commonly found in western and northern Alaska during the summer (where it breeds) and fall. In fall, it stages in spectacular concentrations along the coast of the Yukon-Kukskokwim Delta and further south on the Alaska Peninsula before departing on the longest non-stop migration known for any shorebird species, across the Pacific Ocean down to New Zealand and southeast Australia.
Up to five subspecies of Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) are recognized, breeding from northern Norway to western and northern Alaska.

			<post_content>The International Tundra Experiment
The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) Arctic Observing Network (AON) was started in the early 1990's to study environmental change in the Arctic.
Multiple instruments, configured along a tram-like platform, sense the tundra below and gather detailed data about the Arctic ecosystem while traveling along a 50 meter transect.
The high resolution information is more detailed than that gained by a satellite or by a meteorological station that is situated in one spot. In the video ITEX: Tram powered Nathan Healey, post-doctoral research associate at Florida International University, describes the instruments and types of data they gather.
In a more detailed study, masters student Jose Luciani in video ITEX: Node to Node digitizes the growth variation of individual plants. Luciani wants to know if it is more advantageous for a plant to grow horizontally or vertically in the changing Arctic environment.
Steven Oberbauer, professor of biological sciences, at Florida International University, said: âWe collect the data, we post the data. They are going to be in a national archive, so 50 years from now, if somebody wants to come back, they can look at a 3D image, a 3D movie of the transect. They can look at specific plants that are there over the years, over the days. That's the object of the project, to establish a baseline of high resolution measurements."

Cape Alitak Petroglyphs - Alaska Native Art
The Cape Alitak Petroglyphs are a series of short videos which explore Alutiiq heritage through a study of Kodiak Island rock art and archaeology.
-
For thousands of years, Alutiiq people lived in sod houses and hunted sea mammals, relying on special technologies, ancestral knowledge, and spiritual assistance to care for their families. The Cape Alitak petroglyphs are one of the only written records of their way of life. Pecked into Kodiak's granite bedrock, images of people and animals preserve customs from the Alutiiq past. Museum scientists explain this amazing history in seven short films. We learn about the remarkable environment that surrounds Cape Alitak while hearing the stories its sites reveal.
-
Produced with support from the National Park Service Shared Beringian Heritage Program and a Tribal Historic Preservation grant, the videos document recent archaeological research on Kodiak rock art.
Collaboratively, the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository www.alutiiqmuseum.org and the video production company WonderVisions www.wondervisions.com tell these stories.

			<post_content>Understanding Climate Change Through Archaeology
You've seen ancient bones uncovered by archaeologists in museums, dusty and mysterious, and learned something new about the past. For a zooarchaeologist, bones will give up more secrets than most. Join Mike Etnier, zooarchaeologist at Western Washington University, as he exposes the secrets of bones.
In videos A Zooarchaeologist's Take on Climate Change and Using Middens as Time Machines, Etnier displays bones found in sites once occupied by ancient hunters along the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and describes using those bones to discover information about the distant past. His work investigates how the populations and habitat ranges of animals like the Northern Fur Seal have changed over time due to weather events and human interaction, and even uncovers evidence of past climate shifts. Etnier's findings add more robust data to our ever-growing understanding of Earth's climate past.

Welcome to Frontier Scientists, where new discoveries in the Far North unfold before your eyes.

From the Alaskan Arctic comes a fascinating series of short vodcasts that entertain as well as inspire. Learn how ancient humans hunted whales with poison spears. Watch wildlife encounters in places where bears outnumber people. See how birds benefit from abundant bug life to feed their babies, in one of the world's great wildlife nurseries.

This is field science in one of the last great frontiers.

Frontier Scientists puts you in the front row to observe breaking scientific news from leading Arctic scientists in Archaeology, Geology, Anthropology, the Humanities, Biology, Marine Biology, Ecology, Chemistry and more.

You'll be along when the scientists themselves are startled by the unexpected. Their Living Research Laboratories are so remote, our researchers are often the first modern visitors to set foot in these pristine locations.

You'll also see field reports on amazing natural phenomena, buried archaeological artifacts, grizzly bears, active volcanoes, and ancient Native artistry.

Frontier Scientists is for travelers, teachers, students, aspiring scientists, and anyone interested in scientific discovery in one of the last great unexplored regions--the Alaskan arctic.
